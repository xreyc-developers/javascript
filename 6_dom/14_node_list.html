      NODE LIST
      - is a collection of nodes extracted from a document
      - is almost the same as an HTMLCollection
      - some older browser returns NodeList object instead of HTMLCollection for
      methods like getElementsByClassName()
      - all browser returns nodelist for property ChildNodes
      - most browser returns a NodeList object for method querySelectorAll()

      DIFFERENCE BETWEEK HTMLCOLLECTION AND NODELIST
      - HTMLCollection is a collection of HTML element
      - NodeList is a colletion of document nodes
      - A NodeList and an HTML collection is very much the same thing.
      - Both an HTMLCollection object and a NodeList object is an array-like list (collection) of objects.
      - Both have a length property defining the number of items in the list (collection).
      - Both provide an index (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...) to access each item like an array.
      - HTMLCollection items can be accessed by their name, id, or index number.
      - NodeList items can only be accessed by their index number.
      - Only the NodeList object can contain attribute nodes and text nodes.

      ## A node list is not an array!
      - A node list may look like an array, but it is not.
      - You can loop through the node list and refer to its nodes like an array.
      - However, you cannot use Array Methods, like valueOf(), push(), pop(), or join() on a node list.

    const nodeList = document.querySelectorAll('p');
