      ## LIFECYCLES OF AN HTML HAS 3 IMPORTANT EVENT
      - DOMContentLoaded - the browser fully loaded HTML, and the DOM tree is
      built, but external resources like pictures <img> and stylesheets may not
      yet have loaded.

      - load - not only HTML is loaded, but also all the external
      resources: images, styles etc.

      - beforeunload/unload â€“ the user is leaving the page.

      ## EACH EVENT MAYBE USEFUL
      - DOMContentLoaded event - DOM is ready, so the handler can lookup DOM nodes,
      initialize the iterface.

      - load event - external resources are loaded, so styles are applied, image
      sizes are known etc.

      - beforeunload event - the user is leaving: we can check if the user saved
      the changes and ask them when they really want to leave

      - unload event - the user almost left, but we still can initiate some operation,
      such as sending out statistics.
